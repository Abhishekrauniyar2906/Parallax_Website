# Parallax_Website

Today, we had a fantastic experience learning about Parallax Websites, thanks to the excellent instruction provided by Love Babbar. I gained insights into 3D transformations, 3D preservation, and much more.

A Parallax Website utilizes a design technique where the background moves at a slower pace compared to the foreground as visitors scroll. This creates a dynamic 3D effect, adding depth and enhancing the browsing experience through optical illusion.
